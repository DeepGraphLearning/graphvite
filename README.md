GraphVite is a general graph embedding engine, dedicated to high-speed and
large-scale embedding learning in various applications.

GraphVite provides complete training and evaluation pipelines for 3 applications:
**node embedding**, **knowledge graph embedding** and
**graph & high-dimensional data visualization**. Besides, it also includes 9 popular
models, along with their benchmarks on a bunch of standard datasets.

Here is a summary of the training time of GraphVite along with the best open-source
implementations on 3 applications. All the time is reported based on a server with
24 CPU threads and 4 V100 GPUs.

Requirements
------------

Generally, GraphVite works on any Linux distribution with CUDA >= 9.2.

The library is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.6/3.7.

Installation
------------

### From Conda ###

```bash
conda install -c milagraph -c conda-forge graphvite cudatoolkit=$(nvcc -V | grep -Po "(?<=V)\d+.\d+")
```

If you only need embedding training without evaluation, you can use the following
alternative with minimal dependencies.

```bash
conda install -c milagraph -c conda-forge graphvite-mini cudatoolkit=$(nvcc -V | grep -Po "(?<=V)\d+.\d+")
```

### From Source ###

Before installation, make sure you have `conda` installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/graphvite
cd graphvite
conda install -y --file conda/requirements.txt
mkdir build
cd build && cmake .. && make && cd -
cd python && python setup.py install && cd -
```

### On Colab ###

```bash
!wget -c https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
!./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p /usr/local -f

!conda install -y -c milagraph -c conda-forge graphvite \
    python=3.6 cudatoolkit=$(nvcc -V | grep -Po "(?<=V)\d+\.\d+")
!conda install -y wurlitzer ipykernel
```

```python
import site
site.addsitedir("/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages")
%reload_ext wurlitzer
```

Quick Start
-----------

Here is a quick-start example of the node embedding application.

```bash
graphvite baseline quick start
```

Typically, the example takes no more than 1 minute. You will obtain some output like

```
Batch id: 6000
loss = 0.371041

------------- link prediction --------------
AUC: 0.899933

----------- node classification ------------
macro-F1@20%: 0.242114
micro-F1@20%: 0.391342
```

Baseline Benchmark
------------------

To reproduce a baseline benchmark, you only need to specify the keywords of the
experiment. e.g. model and dataset.

```bash
graphvite baseline [keyword ...] [--no-eval] [--gpu n] [--cpu m] [--epoch e]
```

You may also set the number of GPUs and the number of CPUs per GPU.

Use ``graphvite list`` to get a list of available baselines.

Custom Experiment
-----------------

Create a yaml configuration scaffold for graph, knowledge graph, visualization or
word graph.

```bash
graphvite new [application ...] [--file f]
```

Fill some necessary entries in the configuration following the instructions. You
can run the configuration by

```bash
graphvite run [config] [--no-eval] [--gpu n] [--cpu m] [--epoch e]
```

High-dimensional Data Visualization
-----------------------------------

You can visualize your high-dimensional vectors with a simple command line in
GraphVite.

```bash
graphvite visualize [file] [--label label_file] [--save save_file] [--perplexity n] [--3d]
```

The file can be either a numpy dump `*.npy` or a text matrix `*.txt`. For the save
file, we recommend to use `png` format, while `pdf` is also supported.
